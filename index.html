                   I feel like every once in a while I get sad that I feel like I haven’t been doing as much as I should be. I ended up applying to 30 more internships today because I was scared that I wasn’t trying my hardest to get one for this summer, but I think it’s already too late. I’ve been applying since winter break but I think that was also too late. My friends told me to apply in the fall but I was taking 5 classes and I was trying to balance all of those so I spent most of my time on classes. I switched into the major in my 2nd year spring quarter and I feel like I’m so behind compared to everyone else. <b>I wish I changed into this major in my 1st year instead of wasting time trying to apply to be an Electrical Engineer. </b>

           <h3> Paragraph to Vent </h3>
           <p>
               After taking that CSE 101 quiz, I think I underestimated the class. The homework and lectures seem so trivial compared to the quiz. I feel like I understand most of it and then end up making a simple mistake that causes me 15% on the quiz ): I really do need to triple check my work before I submit it. Also, I think I might change my Math 103B class to P/NP since that quiz was kinda rough. I thought that I would know a little more since I took Math 100B last quarter for 3 weeks before dropping it. When I compare my Math 100B class to this Math 103B class, it seems so much easier, but for some reason, I still don’t understand some of it :/

           <p>
               I’ve played <i> League of Legends </i> before so <i> Wild Rift </i> seems pretty easy to me. Sometimes when I play, I don’t really take it seriously because I can’t tell if my opponents know how to play or not. I also don’t try as hard because I think it’s funny when I make a mistake and end up dying to them. Maybe I’ll start ranking in <i>Wild Rift</i> and I’ll get to diamond like I am on <i>League</i> :^)
           </p>
